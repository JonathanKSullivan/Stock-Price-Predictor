Used supervised learning to study 5 high-valued equities in the technology sector. This is the capstone project for the Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree.

In this project we use Sklearn, Numpy, Pandas, Quandl, Python, Jupyter Notebook

#### Purpose:

In this project I apply supervised learning techniques on historical stock price data collected and distributed by Quandl. 

#### How to Use:

The project has 4 files:
- capstone_report.pdf: Final Report
- capstone_proposal.pdf: Final Report
- stock_predictor.ipynb: This is the main file where my work was performed the project.

To view results Open up a browser window or tab. Click file then open. Navigate to the folder containing the project files and double click capstone_report.pdf and  capstone_proposal.pdf. 

To interact with ipynb file In the Terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to the folder containing the project files, and then use the command jupyter notebook stock_predictor.ipynb to open up a browser window or tab to work with your notebook.
